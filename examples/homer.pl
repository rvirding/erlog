%% Homer Simpson, after a stop at Moe’s, went to the Springfield Mall to buy
%% Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie a gift in anticipation that they will be upset 
%% with him when he gets home. He bought 4 gifts: a green dress for Marge, a 
%% saxophone book for Lisa, a slingshot for Bart and a pacifier for Maggie. He 
%% recalls buying the gifts at: The Leftorium, Sprawl-Mart, Try-N-Save, and King
%% Toots. Somewhere along the way, Homer lost his car keys and had to walk home 
%% carrying the gifts. Wanting to retrace his steps and find his lost car keys, 
%% the family asks Homer where he bought the gifts and the order in which he 
%% bought the gifts. Being partly inebriated however, Homer couldn’t remember 
%% which stores he bought the gifts at and in which order he visited the
%% stores.
%% 
%% After some interrogation, Homer does remember:
%% 
%% · He bought the saxophone book at King Toot’s
%% · The store he visited just after buying the slingshot was not Sprawl-Mart
%% · The Leftorium was his second stop
%% · Two stops after leaving Try-N-Save, he bought the pacifier
%% 
%% Can you help drunken Homer and the Simpson family figure out the order that 
%% Homer bought the gifts and where he bought them?
